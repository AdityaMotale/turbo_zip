## Installation

You can directly install `TurboZip` by adding `turbo_zip: ^1.0.0` to your _pubspec.yaml_ dependencies section

You can also add `TurboZip` to your project by executing,

- For Flutter Project - `flutter pub add turbo_zip`
- For Dart Project - `dart pub add turbo_zip`

## Algorithms

### LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch)

LZW compresses data by replacing repeated substrings with shorter codes, creating a dictionary
dynamically during encoding. It's a lossless method used in _GIF Images_ and _Unix File_ compression.

_LZW_ performs significantly faster then GZip in dart code. Have a look at
[benchmark results](./benchmark/lzw/results.txt).

Here is how you can use `LZW` in your code,

```dart
import 'package:turbo_zip/turbo_zip.dart';

final String originalText = "TO BE OR NOT TO BE OR TO BE OR NOT";

final List<int> encodedText = LZW.encode(originalText);
print("Encoded Text : $encodedText");

final String decodedText = LZW.decode(encodedText);
print("Decoded Text: $decodedText");

print(originalText == decodedText); // true
```

> üëâ Note: Unicode characters like emojis are currently not supported by `LZW`. Keep in mind to handle exceptions thrown by both `encode` and `decode` functions of _LZW_ in your code.

## Benchmarks

To benchmark `turbo_zip` algorithms against industry leading algorithms, dart scripts are created in
`./benchmarks/`. Check them out [here](./benchmark/).
